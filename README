A REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is a way to build web services that interact with databases or systems by following REST architectural principles. A typical REST API supports CRUD operations:

1. GET: Retrieve data from the server/database.
2. POST: Add new data to the server/database.
3. PATCH: Update specific fields of an existing resource in the server/database.
4. DELETE: Remove data from the server/database.

REST API Features -

1. Resource-Based URLs: Each resource (e.g., users, products) has its own unique URL.
2. Stateless: The server does not maintain the client's state; each request is independent.
3. JSON: Data is typically exchanged in JSON format for easy readability and parsing.
4. HTTP Methods: HTTP verbs define the operation (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE).
5. HTTP Status Codes: Used to indicate the result of the request (e.g., 200 for success, 404 for not found, 500 for server errors).

In this code project the use of MIDDLEWARES are also depicted with examples.
